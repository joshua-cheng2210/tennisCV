# project purpose
- this is my intorductory project to experience computer vision and deep learning

# library used
- YoloV5: to detect objects
- opencv

# Learnings
- some pre trained models are not accurate and specialized for your purpose of your project, so you might need to train your own model
- when training your own model weights, you need to have a lots of data
- got training data from roboflow at https://universe.roboflow.com/viren-dhanwani/tennis-ball-detection/dataset/6
- using kaggle's GPU cause my computer only has CPU and it is slow
- the differences betwwen the GPUs offered by kaggle. T4 or P100.
- learn the differences here https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/getting-started/561774
