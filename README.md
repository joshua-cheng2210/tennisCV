# project purpose
- this is my intorductory project to experience computer vision and deep learning

# library used
- YoloV5: to detect objects
- opencv

# Learnings
- some pre trained models are not accurate and specialized for your purpose of your project, so you might need to train your own model
- when training your own model weights, you need to have a lots of data
    - got data to train to detect the tennis ball from roboflow at https://universe.roboflow.com/viren-dhanwani/tennis-ball-detection/dataset/6
    - got the data to train the tennis court from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lhAaeQCmk2y440PmagA0KmIVBIysVMwu/view?usp=drive_link 
- using kaggle's GPU cause my computer only has CPU and it is slow
- the differences betwwen the GPUs offered by kaggle. T4 or P100.
